# FrogCap sequence capture probe-set and pipeline

Note: FrogCap is currently metamorphosing into AmphiCap, a sequence capture probe set for all amphibians, with 25,000 additional markers (AHE markers, BUSCO markers). contact me for more information! 

Welcome to the FrogCap GitHub repository! Please visit [frogcap.com](http://frogcap.com) for the probe set, data analysis pipeline, and tutorials. Please cite the following preprint (soon to be published manuscript) if you use any of these resources. 

Further note, please use the new R package PhyloProcessR and PhyloConfigR for updated data analysis pipelines:
